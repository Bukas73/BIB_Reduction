Contains important scripts (currently just BIB reducing n-tupleizer) and plots contained in paper, with extras

Note on plot file names: m*_d* refers to mass and decay width. Increasing decay with number indicates smaller lifetime.

d1 -- ctau = 100 mm
d2 -- ctau = 10 mm
d3 -- ctau = 1 mm
d4 -- ctau = 0.1 mm
d5 -- ctau = 0.01 mm
